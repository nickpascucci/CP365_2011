Hey all! 
This is my personal git repository for the Colorado College course
CP365: Artificial Intelligence, being taught Block 6 2011.
All of the source in this repository is licensed under the included license.

It includes some basic examples of AI, and will develop as I proceed 

Cheers,
Nick Pascucci
