Genetic Algorithm Readme

This file demonstrates a simple genetic algorithm.
It creates a population of randomly generated 
"chromosomes", each of which represents an approximation
of the target file (test.jpg). The algorithm will 
perform a fitness evaluation on each chromosome, and
meld aspects of the fittest ones together ("mating" them)
and then randomly vary aspects of others based on a 
statistical distribution (mutation). These new chromosomes
will form the next generation, which will repeat the process;
as the algorithm proceeds, it will bear better and better
approximations to the target image. This particular
implementation is probably not the best; but it works fairly
well at around 10,000 generations.
