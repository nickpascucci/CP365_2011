Bug Readme

The files in this dir are based on a simple bug-style
navigation algorithm for robots. The robot has one
bump sensor, which fires whenever the robot comes into
contact with an obstacle. It does not provide direction
information.

Running these files requires that the user have PyGame
installed (pygame.org). Extract the .zip into a directory,
put bug1.py and bug2.py in there, and change the one you
want to run to be MyBug.py. Run the script with

python bugworld.py world1.dat

and life should be good.
