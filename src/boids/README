Boids Readme

The files in this directory are an implementation of 
a simple emergent behavior algorithm. Running Test
will put up a window with a swarm of little 'boids',
each of which follows three simple rules:

	1. Move towards the center of the swarm
	2. Match speed and direction with close neighbors
	3. Maintain a separation from your neighbors
	
Combined with some randomization of their velocities and
a simple mouse following implementation, the boids will
swarm towards the mouse. The little red one in the
middle represents the center of the swarm.
